# HD Project
### The website’s front-end is built using Vue.js
### Grid design and layout using Bootstrap 5
### Customize color and emoji using Vuetify. 
### A backend site powered by PHP, phpMyAdmin, and SQL table. For handling API requests HTTP, I use Axios library.
```
1. Technical Requirements
• Responsive Design: The website is implemented with Bootstrap 5 row-column 
grid system to organize content and layout effectively, ensuring adaptability 
across different device screen sizes (mobile, laptop, iPad). 
• Vue.js Component: Style coding is beautiful and easy to see. Name, methods, 
validation, pagination, computed is used on the website. Creating reusable 
components to streamline development and enhance scalability. Router is 
imported to Router folder and run correctly. 
• Core Vue.js Directives: v-bind, v-model, v-if, v-for, v-on, array is used in the 
template html and callout under script for JavaScript to execute the actions. 
This creates interactive interfaces that respond to the user’s action. 
• External Data Integration: API requests, with dynamic fetching and interaction 
with SQL and backend data. Also, JSON file is used for retrieving pictures for 
website.

3. Functional Requirements 
The website contains some key functionalities: 
• Usability and Accessibility: 
• User Authentication: A nav bar with a space for administration that have 
username and password required to manage the data. 
• Search and Filter: Provide the capabilities for customers to search for food, 
drinks in the menu page, and apply the filters to better finding.
• Random Food: Every time a customer enters the home page, new food as acts 
as an array of three, generate random foods. 
• Social Interactions: A page is created for the users, customers to review the 
restaurant, including voting and comments. These reviews will be eventually 
viewed in the restaurant’s home page. 
• High Distinction Grade: There is an apply page for the users to apply for job at 
the restaurant. The authorized staff logins the administration page can see 
registration, detail contents of the applicants and be able to delete the 
application. 
• Persistent Data Storage: Data is stored through the backend SQL database via 
phpMyAdmin server, the authorized people can create, edit, insert, delete both 
the reviews and application. Maintaining data durability and reliability.
